# JVMX2

Java 7 Virtual Machine for Learning Puroposes. It is written in C++11. It uses [GNU Classpath](https://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/home.html), [Boost](https://www.boost.org/) v1.67.0 and [wallaroo](https://wallaroolib.sourceforge.net/index.html) v0.7.0

## Why Another JVM?

This project was something I wrote because I wanted to challenge myself and because I wanted to learn about Virtual Machines.

## Why make this public?

This project is public so that anyone who is interested in learning about Virtual Machines can use it as resource.

## Why call it JVMX2?

I didn't want to call it "Yet another JVM". This is the second incarnation of the project, hence the "2" at the end.

## Why Java 7?

When I started the project, Java 7 was the latest version. Because this is only a pet project for learning, I have never felt the need to upgrade.
